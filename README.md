Description:
This code implements a Bayesian Network model for weather prediction using the pgmpy library in Python. The Bayesian Network represents the relationship between weather outlook and the occurrence of rain. Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) are defined for the outlook and rain variables, allowing for inference about the likelihood of rain based on the current outlook. The model is validated for consistency and then used to perform inference, providing predicted probabilities of rain given different outlook scenarios (sunny, overcast, rainy). This approach demonstrates the practical application of Bayesian Networks in probabilistic reasoning and decision-making for weather forecasting.
